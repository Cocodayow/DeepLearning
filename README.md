# cogs185_deeplearning

This course is an advanced course that follows the basic Machine Learning methods, in particular along the line of supervised approaches. Advanced and new machine learning methods will be discussed and studied. We will go through some popular topics in machine learning covering:

(1) Multi-class  and multi-label classification, (2) Structural prediction (Structural SVM, Conditional random fields), (3) Hidden Markov models, (4) Recurrent neural networks, (5) Semi-supervised learning and weakly-supervised learning, (6) Compressed sensing, sparsity and low-rank, (7) Self-supervised learning, (8) Generative AI
